# Production-Ready LLM RAG System  
### Research-to-MVP AI Engineering Project

## Overview

This project is a **production-oriented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** designed to bridge the gap between **AI research prototypes and deployable, real-world AI services**.

The primary goal of this project is to explore how **large language models (LLMs)** can be structured, optimized, and deployed as **scalable AI MVPs**, following industry-grade software engineering practices.

The system focuses on **efficient document retrieval, modular NLP pipelines, and API-based deployment**, aligning closely with how AI solutions are built and shipped in applied research and product engineering teams.

## Key Objectives

- Convert **research-style LLM pipelines** into **production-ready AI services**
- Design **modular and extensible RAG architectures**
- Apply **system-level thinking** to AI model deployment
- Emphasize **engineering reliability over experimentation**

## System Architecture

The project follows a clean, modular pipeline:

1. **Document Ingestion**
   - Structured ingestion of unstructured text documents  
   - Chunking and preprocessing for efficient retrieval  

2. **Vector-Based Retrieval**
   - Dense embedding generation  
   - Similarity search using a vector database  

3. **LLM-Based Generation**
   - Context-aware response generation using retrieved documents  
   - Prompt construction optimized for factual grounding  

4. **Inference API Layer**
   - REST-based inference using FastAPI  
   - Stateless, container-friendly design  

5. **Deployment-Ready Packaging**
   - Dockerized service  
   - Configurable for cloud or on-prem environments

## Why This Project Matters

Modern AI systems are not evaluated only on model accuracy, but on:

- How easily they can be deployed  
- How efficiently they scale  
- How well they integrate with real products  

This project emphasizes **AI systems engineering**, not just model training.  
It reflects how AI solutions are actually built inside **research labs transitioning ideas into MVPs and customer-ready products**.

## Use Cases

- Enterprise document question answering  
- Internal knowledge assistants  
- Research-to-production AI prototyping  
- AI MVP development for applied research teams
